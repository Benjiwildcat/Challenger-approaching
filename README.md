# Challenger-approaching

This is a project to challenge my ability to replace <div> soup with more relevant syntax.


In this project I was given starter code with an plethora of div syntax, the basic goal was to replace most

if not all the div with new syntax and support my replacements with changes in the CSS sheet without breaking

the webpage.

## The Process

At the beginning the project went by smoothly replacing a few div semantics with nav and header, however I faced

a bit of trouble on the body part of replacing div with main, section, and nav. It seemed that for the most part

my code was sound but for some reason when I saved my work and checked the page in live server a bunch funky things

were happening. So I checked the starter code again, tried to compare and contrast if I had overlooked something and

Finally I noticed that I had missed something, somehow I had deleted a whole section of my CSS code that controlled

the "float-right" contents. After copying that specific sections starter code back into my CSS code, the page worked

without any errors.

*Naturally there will be a link to the website once deployed but I figured I'd add something else to the README just

so it'll look prettier. Not entirely sure if this link will work or show anything once everything is deployed.
